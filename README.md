# Homework 3: Structs

## Goals

In this homework, you will learn how to:

* Create new data types using struct 
* Pass arguments of the new type
* Understand the difference between passing a structure object
  and passing a pointer to a structure object
* Integrate a function in a range

## Background

### 1. Creating new types in C

C has some built-in data types, such as `char` (characters), `int` (integers), `float` (single-precision floating point numbers), and `double` (double-precision floating point numbers).

C also allows programmers to define new types. There are multiple ways to define new types. In the class we use the following style:

```
typedef struct
{
     // attributes: type - name pairs
     // for example
     int ival;
     double dval;
} TypeName; // remember the ending ;
```

The naming convention we will use in class is that the name of a new type is a *noun* and 
it starts with a *capital letter*.

After creating a type, it can be used to create "objects" (using the
term from C++).  For example,

`TypeName obj1;`

When we declare an `int` variable, we are telling the compiler: "this variable holds one value: an integer."
Similarly, when we create an object of type `TypeName`, we are telling the compiler: "this object is a `TypeName`, which means that it holds two values: an integer and a double."

The attributes of obj1 can be referred to using ".", for example,

`obj1.ival` and `obj1.dval`

### 2. Pointers in C

> This homework uses pointers, but at a fairly superficial level. We will spend a week or two discussing pointers in depth, and later homeworks will test your understanding of pointers.

In C programs, a pointer means a way to refer to a memory address. For
example,

```
int a = 5; // an integer and its value is 5

int * pt;  // a pointer to an integer
pt = & a;  // pt's value stores a's address
```

You can merge the two lines into one:

`int * pt = & a;`

After assigning `a`'s address to `pt`, `pt` can be used to refer to `a`'s value, for example,

```
int b = * pt; // pt at the right hand side (RHS) of =, read the value of a
// b's value is 5 because a's value is 5
```

It is equivalent to

`int b = a; `

If `pt` is at the left hand side (LHS) of `=`, the value of `a` is modified:

`* pt = -3; // a's value is -3`

You cannot assign an arbitrary address to a pointer (except `NULL`). If you do something
like the following, you will get a compiler warning

`int * pt = 5;` 

The reason is that the operating system determines the addresses
available to each program. You do not know whether `5` is a valid
address available to your program (in fact, `5` is never a valid
address).

`NULL` is a special address.

`int * pt = NULL;`

means `pt` points to nowhere.  This is useful when you do not know where
`pt` should point to yet.  In later parts of our class, you will learn
that `NULL` can serve as a "sentinel" value that indicates important things, like the end of pointer chains.

If you create a pointer and do not know where it should point to yet,
initialize it to `NULL`. Uninitialized pointers store garbage addresses
and the program's behavior is unpredictable. 


### 3. Pointers and structures

Earlier, you learned that if `TypeName` is the name of a structure, you can create an object using
this syntax:

`TypeName obj;`

Then, you can use `.` to refer to an attribute:

`obj.ival = 2022; // assign 2022 to the integer attribute`

It is also possible to create a pointer to an object.

`TypeName * opt = & obj;`

To refer to an attribute, you need to replace `.` by `->`

`opt -> ival = 2022;`

> **Note:** you could also write `(* opt).ival` to get the same effect. Why?
> Recall that `(* opt)` is like referring to whatever `opt` points to. Since
> `opt` points to `obj`, `(* opt).ival` is the same as saying `obj.ival`. We
> recommend that you use the `->` syntax, because it is easier to read. 

> One thing to notice is that `(* opt).ival` is *not* the same as
> `*opt.ival`. Why?  The order of operations in the C language states
> that the member operator `.` has a higher precedence than the
> dereference operator `*`. So `*opt.ival` refers to whatever `opt.ival`
> points to! (which in this case will cause an error since `opt.ival` has the data type of `int`).

### 4. Function arguments

When an argument is passed to a function, a copy is created. Thus,
modifying the value inside the called function (callee) does not
affect the value in the caller when the called function
finishes. Consider this example:

```
void f1(int a) // callee
{
    a = 264;
}

// caller
int b = 2022;
f1(b);
// b is still 2022, not 264
```

To modify the value of `b`, it is necessary to pass the address of `b`:

```
void f2(int * a) // callee, a is a pointer
{
    * a = 264;
}

// caller
int b = 2022;
f2(& b); // pass b's address
// b is 264
```

The same rule applies when the argument is a struct:

```
void f3(TypeName obj) // callee
{
    obj.ival = 264;
}

// caller
TypeName obj;
obj.ival = 2022;
f3(obj);
// obj.ival is still 2022, not 264
```

To modify the value, it is necessary to pass the address;

```
void f4(TypeName * opt) // callee
{
    opt -> ival = 264; // notice ->
}

// caller
TypeName obj;
obj.ival = 2022;
f4(& obj); // notice &
// obj.ival is 264
```

### 5. Integrating a function

This assignment asks you to write two C functions to calculate the
definite integration of a function.  Suppose `f` is a function that can
be integrated over the range [`lowerlimit`, `upperlimit`].  If it is
possible to find a closed form for the integration of `f`, let's called
it `int_f`, then the answer would be simple:

`int_f(upperlimit) - int_f(lowerlimit)`

In many cases, however, a closed form is unavailable and we can use
numeric methods to approximate the answer.

One easy approximation assumes that f can be approximated by a
straight line. Thus, the integration can be approximated by using the
middle of [`lowerlimit`, `upperlimit`]:

`(upperlimit - lowerlimit) * f((upperlimit + lowerlimit) / 2)`

This approximation is incorrect if `f` is not a a straight line.  This assignment
asks you to approximate the answer by dividing 
[`lowerlimit`, `upperlimit`] into several intervals. Let's use `n` as the
number of intervals. The integration is approximated by

```
(upperlimit - lowerlimit) / n x 
(
  f(lowerlimit)  + 
  f(lowerlimit + 1 * (upperlimit - lowerlimit) / n) +
  f(lowerlimit + 2 * (upperlimit - lowerlimit) / n) +
  f(lowerlimit + 3 * (upperlimit - lowerlimit) / n) +
  ...
  f(lowerlimit + (n - 1) * (upperlimit - lowerlimit) / n) 
)
```

You can assume that `n` is a positive integer. You do not need to check
whether `n` is zero.  You can assume that `upperlimit` is greater than
`lowerlimit`.

## What do you need to do ?

The only file you need to modify in this assignment is `integrator.c`.
Please read every file in this assignment and understand all details.

You need to implement two functions:

`double integrate1(Range rng);`

The argument provides `lowerlimit`, `upperlimit`, and the number of
intervals (`intervals`). They are three attributes of the type `Range`, defined in `hw3.h`.  `integrate1` should perform a numerical integration of the function `func` (which will be provided for you in files named `func1.c`, `func2.c`, etc.) using the method described above.

and 

`void integrate2(RangeAnswer * rngans);`

This is the function that `hw3.c` calls to find the integral: it takes a `RangeAnswer` struct as an argument (also defined in `hw3.h`). Because the argument is a pointer, setting the `answer` field of `rngans` inside `integrate2` will allow whoever calls `integrate2` to retrieve the answer.

You are strongly encouraged to use `integrate1` when implementing
`integrate2`. Thus, when testing `integrate2`, `integrate1` is also tested,
i.e., when `INTEGRATE_2` is defined, `INTEGRATE_1` is also defined.

Both functions call the function to be integrated `func`.

### Testing your integrator

Five functions are created for you to test. If a function uses the
mathematics library in C (such as func4.c and func5.c), please include
math.h and add -lm after gcc. (You can see how this works in the Makefile)

```
file      function          integration
func1     x                 x * x / 2
func2     x * x             x * x * x / 3
func3     x * x - 3 * x     x * x * x / 3 - 3 * x * x / 2
func4     sin(x)            -cos(x)
func5     cos(x) + sin(x)   sin(x) - cos(x)
```

Each of these functions defines its own version of `func` that gets compiled together with `integrator.c` and `hw3.c` to create your program. So, to integrate the function defined in `func1.c`, you would compile that and link it together with `integrator.c` and `hw3.c`. Here are the Makefile rules that build an integrator for the function in `func1.c`:

```
hw3-func1-1: hw3a.o integrator.o func1.o
	$(GCC) hw3a.o integrator.o func1.o -o hw3-func1-1
	
hw3a.o: hw3.c hw3.h
	$(GCC) -c -DINTEGRATE_1 hw3.c -o hw3a.o
	
func1.o: func1.c
	$(GCC) -c func1.c
	
integrator.o: integrator.c hw3.h
	$(GCC) -c integrator.c
```


For each function, you're provided with 3 testcases. All testcases are in the directory `testcases/`. The format of a test file is:

```
<lower bound (floating point)>
<upper bound (floating point)>
<# intervals (integer)>
<expected answer (floating point)>
```

The provided test files (in the directory `testcases/`) all have the answer you are expected to get (the **approximate** integration results that we should get from the homework). Feel free to generate new tests using answers.xlsx, where you can use answers.xlsx to calculate the "correct" answer (the **exact** integration results that is from exact numerical integration) for the functions you are testing. Note that there is difference between these two and thus we allow 1% difference error in grading.


(If you just run `make` you will get executable programs that will test the `integrate1` and `integrate2` versions of your integrator for all five of the provided test functions)

To *test* your integrator, run `hw3-func1-1` on a test input:

`> ./hw3-func1-1 testcases/test-func1-1`

You can use the Makefile to run through all of our test cases.

To test `integrate1`, use `make hw3-test1`. 

To test `integrate2`, use `make hw3-test2`.


## Notes on good coding habit

### 1. Declare and initialize the variable 

When you declare a variable, initialize the value when appropriate.
Remember, C does NOT initialize values for you. For example, if you do not initialize a pointer, it
stores garbage (not `NULL`).

Examples of declaration and initialization of variables at the same time
```
int i = 0; // an index variable i with initial value as 0
int * pt = NULL; // a pointer pt with initial value as NULL
TypeName obj = {.ival = 0, .dval = 0.0}; // a TypeName object with all attributes' initial value as 0
int arr[3] = {0}; // an integer array with all elements' initial value as 0
```

### 2. Write DRY code

When writing code, a general rule is "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY).
In this assignment, you should implement `integrate2` using `integrate1`
but these two functions are somewhat similar.  This is important
because you need to implement (and debug) the overlapped part only
once.  

If you implement `integrate2` independently of `integrate1`, you are
creating WET ("We Enjoy Typing") code.  You have two similar but
different functions.  This invites mistakes.  Consider the
situation when you find a mistake in `integrate1` and correct it.  It is
highly likely that you forget to correct the mistake in `integrate2`.  

DRY code is good. WET code is bad.


## Grading
Only modify `integrator.c`. 
If you modify other files, your program may be incompatible in grading and you may lose points.

You will receive zero if your program has error or warning from `gcc`.

The teaching staff will run your program using some test cases for the
two integration functions.  Your score is proportional to the number
of test cases the program passes.  For example, suppose 10 test cases
are used for each integration function, there are 20 test
cases. Passing each test receives 5% of the score.  Passing means the
program returns `EXIT_SUCCESS` and provides correct answers.

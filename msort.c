/*
Merge sort function. Sorts an array with base address base, with nel elements where each element takes up space of size width.

INPUT:
base: a pointer to the beginning of the array to be sorted
nel: the number of elements in the array pointed to by base
compar: a function pointer to compare two elements in the base array

OUTPUT:
the function has no return value,
but after msort, base now should point to a sorted array
